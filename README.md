# Degassing-Sstations-Network
This network represents the wells connected to specific station and visualize different parameters through this network.
The flow-station wells represented based on Two factors: GOR and Water-cut
Different shapes for High water-cut[Square] and the regualr circle size depends on the water-cut value as well
GOR represented by the edge line, if it exceeds a certain value it will turn into red edge line.
